Project Summary
We are building a web-based application called Medsplain that helps patients understand their prescribed medications in plain, easy-to-read language. The tool uses AI (GPT-4o-mini) to summarize official FDA medication information into 6th–8th grade explanations and answer follow-up questions.
We will test our prototype with adult volunteers to measure how well users understand the information and how confident they feel after using it.



What will participants do?

Participants will:

Visit a secure website or test environment.

Enter or choose a medication name (e.g., Lipitor).

Read an AI-generated plain-language explanation.

Answer a short comprehension quiz (5 questions) and feedback survey (~5–10 minutes total).
No personal medical data or identifying information will be collected. Participants can stop anytime.



Participants

• Number: ~30 participants

• Age: 18+ only

• Recruitment: friends, coursemates, and community members who are comfortable using a smartphone or computer.

• Eligibility: Must be fluent in English; no minors or vulnerable populations.

• Compensation: None (voluntary participation).




Data Collected

We will collect:

• Anonymous quiz responses (correct/incorrect)

• Anonymous survey ratings (e.g., “How confident do you feel?”)

• Session data (time spent, which medication was tested)

• No names, emails, or health conditions will be collected

Data will be stored on a secure, password-protected database with random session IDs only.




Privacy & Data Protection


• No personal identifiers are collected.

• All data is anonymized and stored in a secure database (PostgreSQL on Render).

• Access limited to team members only.

• Data deleted within 90 days of project end.

• No external sharing or publication.




Informed Consent


Participants will see a short consent form before starting that explains:


•The purpose of the study

• What they will do

• That participation is voluntary

• That no personal or health data is collected

• That they can stop anytime

• That this is educational, not medical advice

✅ They must click “I agree” before continuing.



Risks

Minimal risk.

No data will be shared or used beyond this course.


Research Ethics Contact

If participants have questions or concerns, they may contact the course instructor or the university IRB office.
