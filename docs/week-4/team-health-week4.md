## ⚠️ What Needs Improvement

### Challenge 1: Meeting Schedule Flexibility

**Description:** Team members have varying schedules across different weeks (other coursework, exams, personal commitments), making it difficult to maintain a fixed weekly meeting time like "every Wednesday 6pm."

**Impact:** Very minimal - we're still meeting regularly, just not on a fixed schedule. This is more of an administrative adjustment than a real problem.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Shift to dynamic scheduling: coordinate meeting times at the start of each week via WhatsApp poll
2. Maintain 1-2x/week sync meetings as before, just flexible timing
3. Continue daily async check-ins (unchanged)
4. Document key decisions in Slack for absent members

**Owner:** Mariam (team coordinator)

**Target Date:** Already implemented - working well since Week 3
