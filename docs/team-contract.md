## Team Mission & Goals

**Our Mission:**  
[1-2 sentences describing what you want to achieve together]

**Our Goals for This Semester:**

We will explore and iteratively develop features and artifacts that demonstrate understanding of AI-powered application design, while remaining flexible about scope and outcomes. The emphasis will be on learning, experimentation, and incremental progress rather than strict, narrowly-defined deliverables.

1. Continue exploring ideas and refining approaches as the project evolves
2. Build and iterate on components that help demonstrate core AI concepts in the project
3. Share progress and learnings regularly, adjusting plans based on feedback and discoveries

## Work Process & Tools

### Development Workflow

**Version Control:**

- Platform: GitHub
- Branch Strategy: e.g., main + feature branches, dev branch + PRs.
- Commit Message Format: ordinary commit messages with text in front, denoting if it's a feature, bugfix, or else. E.g. "feature: added landing page".

**Task Management:**

- Platform: Trello
- Task Assignment: Self-assignment
- Status Updates: On weekly meetings

### Contribution Tracking

We will track contributions through:

- [x] GitHub commit history and PR contributions
- [x] Task completion in Trello
- [x] Weekly progress reports (rotating responsibility)
- [x] Peer evaluation forms (mid-term and final)

**Expected Contribution:**  
Each team member should contribute relatively evenly each week.

## Decision-Making Process

### Routine Decisions

- Method: Majority vote, consensus, assigned owner decides
- Timeline: Decided within 24 hours

### Major Decisions

- Method: Unanimous agreement requirement
- Timeline: Discuss in team meeting
- Documentation: Short recording in md file

### If We Can't Agree:

1. Take a break and research our and opposite view
2. Consult instructor
3. If nothing changes, decide with majority

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Step 1: Direct Communication

- Address issues directly with the person(s) involved
- Use "I feel" statements, not accusations
- Focus on the problem, not the person
- Timeline: Within 48 hours of issue arising

### Step 2: Team Discussion

- Bring it to the full team in a scheduled meeting
- Everyone gets a chance to speak
- Focus on finding a solution, not assigning blame
- Document the agreed resolution

### Step 3: Instructor Mediation

- Contact the instructor via email (include all team members)
- Provide a brief summary of the issue and steps already taken
- Instructor will schedule a mediation session

### Common Issues & Agreed Solutions

**If someone misses a deadline:**

- To prevent missing a deadline, team checks in a bit early.
- If deadline is missed, we try to make up later.

**If someone isn't responding to communications:**

- Call, text, try to locate the person, if all else fails, contact instructor.

**If workload feels unequal:**

- Just communicate directly, using combination of feelings and factual data, to back it up(e.g. logs)

**If technical disagreement arises:**

- Consult somebody who is more experienced
